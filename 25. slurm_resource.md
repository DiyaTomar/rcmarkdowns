## Resource Manager

- SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is a **resource manager** (RM), also known as a _queueing system_.
- Resource managers are used to submit jobs to compute nodes from an access point generally called a _frontend_.
- Frontends are intended for editing, compiling, and very short test runs. Production jobs go to the compute nodes through the RM.

## Resource Requests

- A **job** (aka **batch job**) is described through a special form of shell script which contains directives to the RM to request resources.
- Directives are pseudocomments that take a particular form. They are read by the RM to determine the resource requirement. The job is then placed into the queue.
- Once a resource becomes available the job is started on a master compute node. The master runs the job script, treating the directives as comments.

## Slurm Resource Requests

SLURM refers to queues as partitions. We do not have a default partition; each job must request one explicitly.

- Each master process corresponds to a task.
- By default, each task is assigned to one core.
- Resources are classified as
  - Core: often called "cpu" in directives but refers to each individual processing core
  - Node: a separate computing entity containing multiple CPU cores that can share the same memory.

<u>**Example**</u>

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --mem=32000 # mb total memory
#SBATCH â€“-time=1-12:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=standard
#SBATCH --account=rivanna-training
./myexec < input > output
```

- The lines beginning with #SBATCH request
  - 1 node, 1 task, which by default uses a single core.
  - 32GB of memory (measured in MB).
  - 1 day and 12 hours of running time.
  - The standard partition (queue). A partition must be specified.
  - Account group rivanna-training
  - The job runs a serial executable myexec with input and output files redirected from standard input and standard output.
- We would call this script whatever name we choose, say myjob.slurm
