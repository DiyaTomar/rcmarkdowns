## Paths

- In UNIX all files and directories have a “path”

  - The “path” is the fullname of every file & directory

- At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else.
  We refer to it using a slash character / on its own;
  this is the leading slash in `/home/gka6a`

- Examples:
  - `/`
  - `/home/gka6a`
  - `/home/gka6a/rivanna-cl_013020`
  - `/home/gka6a/rivanna-cl_013020/basic_commands`

Example:

- `/home/gka6a/rivanna-cl` # This is an absolute path.

The current directory can be represented by a period (.)

Thus if we are in `/home/gka6a/rivanna-cl/basic_commands` we can type

- `gedit ./hello_world.sh &` # to edit

or

- `./hello_world.sh` # to execute the file

### Summary

- **Absolute paths**

  - The path to a file starting at the root of the system
  - Begins with “/” to denote the path starts at the root
  - Guaranteed to get you there

- **Relative paths**

  - The path to a file starting at the current location
  - Indicate current directory with “.”, parent directory as “..”
  - Can break if you start in the wrong place!
