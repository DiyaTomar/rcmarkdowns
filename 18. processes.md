## Process Control

- Running from a command line:
- Processes can be running in the foreground (no prompt returned to the shell) or background (prompt available). To
  start in the background, add an ampersand (`&`) at the end, **`./myexec -o myopt myfile &`**

- **`jobs`** # lists the running jobs with job index
- `control-z` (`ctrl-z` or `^z`): suspends the job
- **`bg %1`** # place the job number 1 into the background
- **`fg %4`** # place the job number 4 back to the
  foreground

## Killing Processes

- `control-c` (`ctrl-c` or `^c`): kill the current running job (must be foregrounded).
- Find the process ID with **`ps`** then: **`kill -9 <pid>`** terminates with extreme prejudice.
- **`killall -9 <executable name>`** same as above.
