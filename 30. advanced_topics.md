## Dotfiles - Configuration Files

- “Dotfiles” are files that describe resources to programs that look for them.
- They begin with a period or “dot” (hence the name).
- Hidden from `ls`, but `ls -a` shows them. Sometimes `ls` is aliased to `ls –a`.
- Bash has two `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc`
- if no `.bash_profile` is present it will read `.profile`
- `.bash_profile` is sourced only for login shell

## Environment Variables

- The search path is the set of directories that the operating system will search when you type the name of an executable. To see it, type

  `printenv PATH`

- `PATH` is an _environment variable_. Environment variables describe something about your working environment.
  Some of them you can set or modify; others are set by the system.
- `printenv` prints all environment variables currently set.
- `export VAR` allows variable to be passed to child shells
- Bash only, sets and exports in one line `export VAR=value`

## Slurm Environment Variables

- SLURM provides several environment variables that acquire values from the system.
- Do not attempt to assign to any variable beginning with SLURM\_
- Directory from which job was submitted <span style="color: green;">SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR</span>
  - Default is to cd to this directory before starting job
- List of nodes <span style="color: green;">SLURM_JOB_NODELIST</span>
- Job ID <span style="color: green;">SLURM_JOB_ID</span>
- Number of task <span style="color: green;">SLURM_NTASKS</span>
- Task per node (if set in script) <span style="color: green;">SLURM_NTASKS_PER_NODE</span>
- Number of cores per task (if set in script) <span style="color: green;">SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK</span>

## Job Arrays

- Many similar jobs can be submitted through job arrays.
- Must be a batch job.
- Submit with `--array=<range>` option

  `sbatch --array=0-30 myjobs.sh`

- An increment can be provided

  `sbatch --array=1-7:2 myjobs.sh`

  - This will number them 1, 3, 5, 7

- Or provide a list

  `sbatch --array=1,3,4,5,7,9 myjobs.sh`

- Each job will be provided an environment variable <span style="color: green;">SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID</span>
- And each task will be assigned <span style="color: green;">SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID</span> based on the numbers in the specified range or list.

## Array Script

- Job arrays should be named (any job can be, job arrays should be named).

`#SBATCH --job-name=<name>`

- or

`#SBATCH -J <name>`

- All subjobs will use the same global resource requests.
- A variable `%A` represents the overall `SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID` and `%a` represents `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` in the `–o` and `–e` directives.

## File Specifications

- It would be prudent to separate stdout and stderror

`#SBATCH -o myjobs%A%a.out`
`#SBATCH -e myjobs%A%a.err`

- Prepare files with appropriate names, e.g.

`myinput.0.in, myinput.1.in, …myinput.30.in`

- Invoke your program with a line such as

`./myexec myinput.${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.in`

<u>**Example Script**</u>

```
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH -t 04:00:00
#SBATCH -J montecarlo
#SBATCH -A rivanna-training
#SBATCH –p standard
#SBATCH -o output%A.%a
#SBATCH -e error%A.%a
./mccode < input${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.dat
```
