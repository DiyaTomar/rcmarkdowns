## Running Executables

- Executables are often called binaries, especially by Unix types and computer programmers. The terms are synonymous in most cases.
- If the executable is in your _search path_, you can simply type its name
  at the prompt.

      **`gedit hello_world.slurm`**

      here `gedit` is the name of the binary. Its actual location is `/usr/bin/gedit`, but `/usr/bin` is in the default search path.

- If it is not in your search path, you must type the path to the executable (can be absolute or relative)

  **`./hello_world.slurm`**

Usually, current directory is not in your default search path for security
reasons.

<u>**Example**</u>

- In most cases, current working directory (.) is not in your default search path. To add it, type (for bash)

  **`export PATH=$PATH:.`**

In this case it is essential to add the first `$PATH` or you will lose the default path set by the system.
