## Standard Streams

- Each executable has associated with it, three I/O streams: **standard input, standard error**, and **standard output.**
- Normally these streams come from or go to your console (i.e. your shell).
- Most Unix commands read from standard input and/or write to standard output.
- They are often represented as **stdin, stderr**, and **stdout**.

## Stream Redirection

- You can redirect standard input with `<`
  - **`mycode < params.txt`**
- Redirect standard output with `>`
  - **`ls â€“l > filelist`**
- Append with ``>>`
  - **`cat file1 >> bigfile`**
- Redirection of standard error depends on the shell
- Bash:
  - **`make >& make.out`**
  - Redirects both stdout and stderr to make.out
