## Bash History Mechanism

- When using bash you may use its built-in history mechanism to save yourself some keystrokes.
  - Up arrow: scroll through the previous commands you have typed
  - Down arrow: if scrolled back, scroll to more recent commands
  - Left/right arrows: edit text on a line

## More Bash Goodies

Tab completion: `string<tab>` causes bash to expand string further as far as it has a unique name.

Search for earlier command: `control-r  <text>`

Move to the beginning of the line: `control-a`

Move to the end of the line: `control-e`

Clear the screen: `clear or control-l`
