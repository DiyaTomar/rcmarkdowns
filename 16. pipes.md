## Pipes

- One of the most powerful properties of Unix is that you can **pipe** the standard output of one command into the standard input of another.
- The pipe symbol `|` is above the backslash on most US keyboards.

Example: **`grep "@H-148:116" SP_R1.fastq | head`**

**`grep`** searches for the pattern in the file and `head` looks at the first 10 lines of the **`grep`** output
