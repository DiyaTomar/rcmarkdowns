## Submitting a Job

- We use the sbatch command to submit the job: `sbatch myjob.slurm`

  The system returns a `JOBID`.

- We do not make the script executable. The system handles that.

## Checking the Job

- Once we submit it, we can monitor active jobs with

  `squeue`

  `squeue -u gka6a` # If I only want to see my jobs I can use

- Job status:

  `PD` pending

  `R` running

  `CG` exiting

<u>**Exercise**</u>

- Change directory to scripts and run the slurm file `hello_world.slurm`
- What do you see when you run `squeue -u <yourID>`

## Deleting a Job

- If you need to cancel a job use `scancel` with
  the job ID (you must always know the job ID)
