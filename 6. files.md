## Files and Processes

- Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. Directories are special type of files.
- Files and directories are two important constructs in UNIX (and most operating systems).
- Contain your documents, images, code, programs, OS, etc.
- A “filesystem” is a collection of files and directories stored on a single physical device.
  - Often called “drives” in Windows

## Files and Directories

- Files store some sort of information
  - Two basic types of files:
    - Text (documents, code)
    - Binary (images, executables)
  - Unix doesn’t pay attention to file extensions, but software might

- Directories are collections of files and directories
  - Analogous and interchangeable with “folders”

- Both files and directories have “metadata” associated with them
  - Name, timestamps, permissions
