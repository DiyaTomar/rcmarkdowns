## Overview

### Unix

- **Unix:** A shell text-oriented operating system originally developed at Bell Labs during 1960s.

  - pull and convert Docker containers
  - inspect a container
    - Dominate OS used at HPC facilities, internet servers, majority of financial trades worldwide, billion Android devices.
  - Mac OSX graphical operating system.
  - GUI is available, but mostly through shell!

- Navigation
- Manipulation of files and directories
  - Examine files
  - Edit files
  - Execute files
  - Transfer files

- **Kernel** is at the heart of the OS.

  - Allocation of time and memory to programs/applications
  - Handling the filesystem and communications in response to system calls

- **Shell** is a program that interprets commands and acts as an interface between the user and the kernel.

- Programs/Applications

### Shell

- There are several shells available. In most newer systems the default is `bash` (Bourne again shell). MacOS has switched recently to `zsh`

- You will have a customizable **prompt** which indicates that the shell is ready to accept commands. On Rivanna the default is `-bash-4.2$`

- To find out your shell, at the prompt type `echo $shell`

- Unix in general and the shell in particular is **case-sensitive.**

- The syntax of commands is not completely standardized but in general is `cmd -o --options filename`

- The pattern is a two or three-letter abbreviation, single-letter options preceded by one hyphen, multiple-letter options with two hyphens, and arguments at the end.

  Example: `rm myfile`

  1. Shell searches for the file that contains the program `rm`
  2. Shell requests kernel through system calls to execute rm on `myfile`
  3. Shell then returns the UNIX prompt to the user, indicating that it is waiting for further commands.

### Supercomputer

**Rivanna** is the university's primary resource for high-performance computation. It provides a platform for computationally-intensive research across disciplines.
