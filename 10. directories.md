## Changing Directories

- `cd` (change directory) is used to jump from one directory to another.

- `cd ..` Changes your present location to the parent directory.
- `cd` with no directory name puts you into your home directory.
- `cd ~` Changes to home directory

## Creating Directories

- `mkdir` (make directory)

- You can use absolute paths or relative paths for the directory name.

- Letâ€™s work these examples!
  - `mkdir newcode`
  - `mkdir /home/gka6a/newcode/build`
  - `cd newcode`
  - `mkdir ../oldcode`
  - `mkdir src`
  - `mkdir ../oldcode/src`
