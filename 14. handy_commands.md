## Handy Commands

- Basic documentation for a command can be read from the shell with the man (manual)
  command: **`man ls`**

- Alternatively: **`whatis ls`**

**`whoami`** # show my user ID
**`which <executable>`** # indicates the path to the executable specified
**`wc (-l/-w/-m) <file>`** # word/line/character count
**`date`** # Shows instantaneous date and time
**`exit`** # exit current shell (if login shell, this logs you off!)

## Wildcards

- Strings of characters may be replaced with wildcards.
- The asterisk (\*) can replace zero to unlimited characters (it does not replace a leading period).
- The question mark (?) replaces exactly one character.
- Wildcards enable you to work with files without needing to type multiple files with similar names.

  **`ls *py`**

  **`rm list?.sh`**

- <span style="color: red;">BE CAREFUL</span> when using wildcards with `rm!` Gone is gone!
  On some systems there may be backups, or maybe not, and on
  your personal system you would need to set up backups and
  learn to retrieve files.
