## The Modules Environment

- Not strictly a part of Unix
- Widely used by many HPC sites, including ours.
- Enables the user to set complex paths, environment variables, and so forth, by loading a module (running a script).
- The environment is set up automatically when you log in.
- Loaded modules only affect the shell in which the command is run.
- Modules required for a job must be loaded in the batch job script.

## Modules Commands

  - List all available packages (may be a lot!)
