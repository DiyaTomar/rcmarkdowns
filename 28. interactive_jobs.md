## Interactive Jobs

- Most HPC sites, including UVa's, restrict the memory and time allowed to processes on the frontend.
- The basic SLURM command to request interactive resources is **`salloc`**.
- However, it requires several options to work well so we have a local script called **`ijob`**
- **`ijob`** takes the same arguments as the SLURM commmand **`salloc`**

```
ijob –c 1 –A myalloc -t <time> --mem <memory
in MB> -p <partition> -J <jobname>
```

<u>**Example**</u>

- Jupyter-lab
  ```
  module load gcc jupyter_conda/.2020.11-py3.8
  jupyter-lab &
  ```
- Rstudio
  ```
  module load goolf/11.2.0_4.1.4 R/4.2.1 rstudio
  rstudio &
  ```
- MATLAB
  ```
  module load matlab/R2023a
  matlab &
  ```
