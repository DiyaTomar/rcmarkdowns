## Running Jobs from Scratch

- We recommend that you run your jobs out of your `/scratch` directory for two reasons:

  - `/scratch` is on Weka filesystem (a storage system designed specifically for parallel access).
  - `/scratch` is connected to the compute nodes with Infiniband (a very fast network connection).

- We also recommend that
  - You <span style="color: red;">keep copies</span> of your programs and data in <span style="color: red;">more permanent locations</span> (e.g., your home directory or leased storage such as `/project` or `/value`).
  - After your jobs finish, you copy the results to more permanent storage.
