## Creating and Editing Files

- **`gedit`**
- **`vi(vim)`**
  - To enter the insert mode press **i**
  - To enter the command mode press **ESC**
  - To save the file enter `:w filename`
  - To exit without save `:q`
- **`nano`**
  - Immediately start typing
  - To exit: control+X
  - Type the filename and press Enter
- **`vscode`**
  - `module load code-server/4.16.1`
  - `code-server`
  - Open the browser and copy the given url from terminal (http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

## Transfer Files

- **`scp`**
  - `scp l_SOURCE jus2yw@rivanna.hpc.virginia edu:r_TARGET`
  - `scp jus2yw@rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu:r_SOURCE l_TARGET`
- **`rsync`**
  - `rsync -av ldir/ jus2yw@rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu:rdir`
  - `rsync my_file jus2yw@Rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu:/scratch/$USER`
- **`sftp`**`
  - `sftp jus2yw@Rivanna.hpc.virginia.edu`
    - `Sftp> put myfile` # transfer from local to Rivanna
    - `Sftp> get myfile` # transfer from Rivanna to local

## Viewing Contents of a File

- **`less`** `FILENAME`

  ![viewing file contents image](img\viewingfile.png)

- Displays file contents on the screen with line scrolling (to scroll you can use ‘arrow’ keys, ‘PgUp/PgDn’ keys, ‘space bar’ or ‘Enter’ key). Press “q” to exit.
- In most implementations you can search in the forward direction with `/<pattern>`

- `/<WORD_PATTERN>`
- `/UNIX`

- **`head`** `FILENAME`

  - Displays only the starting lines of a file. The default is first ten lines. Use “-n” to specify number of lines.
  - `head intro_basic-unix.txt –n 5`

- **`tail`** `FILENAME`

  - Displays the last 10 lines.
  - `less intro_basic-unix.txt –n 5`

- **`grep`** is commonly used in UNIX to filter a file/input, line by line, against a pattern (e.g., to print each line of a file which contains a match for pattern).

  `grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN FILENAME`

  **`grep -i "Unix" intro_basic-unix.txt`**

A handy trick for bioinformaticians:

how many sequences are in a FASTA-formatted file? Each sequence record in a FASTA file has one line of description that always starts with “>” , followed by multiple lines of sequence itself. Each sequence record ends when the next line starting with “>”.

## Copying Files

- **`cp`** (copy) is used to copy a file. When using this command, you must provide both source file and destination file.
  ![copying files image](img\copyingfiles.png)

- You can copy using relative paths: `cp thisfile ../../place/else/thatfile`
- Copy all files in a directory and its subdirectories: `cp –R thisdir thatdir`
- Do not overwrite an existing file (noclobber): `cp –n oldfile newfile`
- Ask before overwriting (-i and –n override each other): `cp –i oldfile newfile`

## Moving a File or Directory

- **`mv`** (move) is used to move or rename a file or directory.
  Moving: **`mv`** `FILE DIR`  
  Renaming: **`mv`** `OLDNAME NEWNAME`

## Deleting Files and Directories

- **`rmdir`**` (remove directory) is used to delete empty directories from the system.

  **`rmdir`** `DIRECTORY`

- **`rm`** (remove) is used to delete a file or a directory. “-r” option for recursive action.

  **`rm`** `-r DIRECTORY`

  **`rm`** `FILE`
